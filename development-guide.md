# Development Guide for ChainReaction

This document provides guidelines for implementing the ChainReaction word game application using React with TypeScript and Supabase. It outlines development standards, code conventions, and changelog maintenance procedures that should be followed throughout the development process.

## Project Overview

ChainReaction is a competitive word puzzle game where players complete word chains by finding connecting words between a start and end word. Each word in the chain differs from adjacent words by exactly one letter. The application will be built with:

- Frontend: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Authentication: Supabase Auth

Please refer to the PRD and To-Do list for detailed requirements and development tasks.

## Development Standards

### Code Structure

1. **Follow TypeScript Best Practices**
   - Use proper type declarations for all variables, parameters, and return types
   - Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary
   - Create dedicated interface and type files in a `types` directory

2. **Component Organization**
   - Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
   - Organize components in a logical directory structure:
     ```
     src/
     ├── components/
     │   ├── common/
     │   ├── game/
     │   ├── auth/
     │   └── layout/
     ├── hooks/
     ├── utils/
     ├── services/
     ├── types/
     ├── pages/
     └── assets/
     ```

3. **State Management**
   - Use Zustand for global state management
   - Prefer React context for component-level state sharing
   - Keep state as close to where it's used as possible

### Database Schema

Follow the Supabase database schema defined in the PRD, ensuring proper relationships between tables and appropriate Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

### Code Quality

1. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for utility functions and hooks
   - Write component tests for UI components
   - Create integration tests for critical user flows

2. **Linting and Formatting**
   - Use ESLint with TypeScript rules
   - Use Prettier for consistent code formatting
   - Set up pre-commit hooks to enforce linting and formatting

3. **Documentation**
   - Document all functions, hooks, and components using JSDoc
   - Include comments for complex logic sections
   - Keep the README.md updated with setup and development instructions

## Changelog Management

### Changelog.md File

The `CHANGELOG.md` file must be created at the root of the project and maintained throughout development. It serves as a chronological record of all notable changes to the project.

### Changelog Format

Follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to ChainReaction will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Feature A
- Feature B

### Changed
- Modification to feature C

### Fixed
- Bug in component D

## [0.1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD
### Added
- Initial project setup
- Core game mechanics implementation
```

### Entry Categories

Each changelog entry should be categorized under one of the following headers:

- **Added**: New features or capabilities
- **Changed**: Changes to existing functionality
- **Deprecated**: Features that will be removed in upcoming releases
- **Removed**: Features removed in this release
- **Fixed**: Bug fixes
- **Security**: Vulnerability fixes

### Update Procedures

1. **When to Update**
   - After completing a significant feature or component
   - When fixing bugs
   - Before creating a release
   - After major refactoring work

2. **How to Update**
   - Add new entries to the top of the "Unreleased" section
   - Be specific but concise about what was changed
   - Reference issue or ticket numbers when applicable
   - Include contributor attribution when appropriate

3. **Release Process**
   - When creating a new release, rename the "Unreleased" section to the version number and add the date
   - Create a new "Unreleased" section at the top
   - Tag the release in Git using semantic versioning

### Changelog Entry Examples

Good:
```
### Added
- User authentication flow with Supabase Auth (#12)
- Daily challenge mode with global leaderboard (#15)
- Word validation service with dictionary lookup (#18)
```

Bad:
```
### Changed
- Made updates
- Fixed some bugs
- Improved the UI
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Include changelog updates in every pull request that affects user-facing functionality
2. Link the PR to relevant issues or tickets
3. Ensure all tests pass before submitting for review
4. Request reviews from appropriate team members

## Version Naming Convention

Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- MAJOR: Incompatible API changes
- MINOR: Added functionality (backward-compatible)
- PATCH: Bug fixes (backward-compatible)

For pre-release versions, use:
- Alpha: 0.1.0-alpha.1
- Beta: 0.1.0-beta.1
- Release Candidate: 0.1.0-rc.1

## Deployment Checklist

Before each deployment:

1. Ensure the changelog is updated and accurate
2. Tag the release in git using the version number
3. Run the complete test suite
4. Update the README with any necessary changes
5. Create a release document summarizing key changes
6. Update the version number in package.json

## Monitoring Procedures

After deployment:

1. Monitor error tracking services
2. Watch user feedback channels
3. Be prepared to roll back if critical issues arise
4. Document any post-release issues in the next changelog entry

By following these guidelines, we'll maintain a consistent, high-quality codebase and keep a detailed history of all changes to the ChainReaction project that will be valuable for both developers and users.
