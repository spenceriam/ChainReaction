# ChainReaction: Testing Plan

## Manual Sanity Checks

Before implementing formal testing frameworks, let's perform these manual checks to verify core functionality.

### Authentication

- [ ] User can sign up with email and password
- [ ] User can log in with correct credentials
- [ ] User cannot log in with incorrect credentials
- [ ] Password reset functionality works
- [ ] User can log out successfully
- [ ] Protected routes are not accessible when logged out

### Core Game Mechanics

- [ ] Word chains display correctly with start and end words
- [ ] User can input words in the chain
- [ ] Word validation correctly identifies:
  - [ ] Valid dictionary words
  - [ ] Words that differ by exactly one letter from adjacent words
  - [ ] Invalid words (not in dictionary)
- [ ] Feedback system correctly shows green/yellow/red indicators
- [ ] Chain visualization updates properly as words are added

### Game Modes

#### Daily Challenge
- [ ] New challenge appears each day
- [ ] Same challenge appears for all users on the same day
- [ ] User can only submit once per day
- [ ] Score is calculated correctly based on time and attempts
- [ ] Streak counting works correctly

#### Timed Mode
- [ ] Timer starts correctly
- [ ] Timer counts down accurately
- [ ] Score increases appropriately with completed chains
- [ ] Difficulty progression works as intended
- [ ] Game ends when timer reaches zero
- [ ] Final score is calculated correctly

#### Endless Mode
- [ ] Chain generation continues indefinitely
- [ ] Difficulty increases progressively
- [ ] Score accumulates correctly
- [ ] High score is recorded properly
- [ ] Game state persists if user refreshes accidentally

### Leaderboards

- [ ] Daily leaderboard displays current day's results
- [ ] Weekly leaderboard aggregates scores correctly
- [ ] Timed mode leaderboard shows highest scores
- [ ] Endless mode leaderboard shows highest scores
- [ ] User's position is highlighted on leaderboards
- [ ] Leaderboards update in real-time or with minimal delay

### User Profile

- [ ] Profile displays correct user information
- [ ] Statistics show accurate game history
- [ ] Achievements display correctly if implemented
- [ ] Game history shows past challenges and scores

### General UI/UX

- [ ] Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- [ ] Navigation between screens is intuitive
- [ ] No visual glitches or layout issues
- [ ] Loading states are properly indicated
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful

## Formal Testing Implementation Plan

### 1. Unit Tests

#### Setup
- [ ] Install Jest and React Testing Library
- [ ] Configure test environment
- [ ] Create test utilities and mocks for Supabase

#### Core Game Logic Tests
- [ ] Word validation function tests
  - Test with valid words
  - Test with invalid words
  - Test with edge cases (capitalization, special characters)
- [ ] Chain validation algorithm tests
  - Test complete valid chains
  - Test chains with broken connections
  - Test edge cases
- [ ] Scoring system tests
  - Test base score calculation
  - Test time multiplier calculation
  - Test attempt efficiency bonus
  - Test difficulty multiplier
  - Test streak bonuses

#### Component Tests
- [ ] Authentication component tests
  - Test form validation
  - Test submission handling
  - Test error states
- [ ] Game interface component tests
  - Test word display
  - Test input handling
  - Test feedback visualization
- [ ] Leaderboard component tests
  - Test data rendering
  - Test sorting and filtering
  - Test empty states

### 2. Integration Tests

- [ ] Authentication flow tests
  - Test signup to login flow
  - Test authentication persistence
  - Test protected route access
- [ ] Game mode flow tests
  - Test daily challenge completion flow
  - Test timed mode game cycle
  - Test endless mode progression
- [ ] Supabase API integration tests
  - Test data fetching operations
  - Test data submission operations
  - Test real-time subscription functionality

### 3. End-to-End Testing

- [ ] Setup Cypress for E2E testing
- [ ] User journey tests
  - New user registration to game completion
  - Returning user login to game completion
  - Profile management
  - Leaderboard interaction
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility tests
  - Chrome
  - Firefox
  - Safari
  - Edge
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness tests
  - Mobile phone (portrait)
  - Mobile phone (landscape)
  - Tablet
  - Desktop

### 4. Performance Testing

- [ ] API response time benchmarking
  - Authentication operations
  - Game data operations
  - Leaderboard operations
- [ ] Rendering performance
  - Component render time
  - Animation smoothness
  - State updates efficiency
- [ ] Database query performance
  - Query execution time
  - Index optimization
- [ ] Load testing
  - Simulate concurrent users
  - Test leaderboard updates under load
  - Test game state synchronization under load

## Testing Schedule

1. **Week 1**: Complete manual sanity checks and fix any critical issues
2. **Week 2**: Set up testing frameworks and implement unit tests
3. **Week 3**: Implement integration tests
4. **Week 4**: Set up and run end-to-end tests
5. **Week 5**: Conduct performance testing and optimization

## Bug Tracking and Resolution

- All bugs found during testing will be documented with:
  - Description
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected behavior
  - Actual behavior
  - Severity level
  - Screenshots/videos (if applicable)
- Bugs will be prioritized based on:
  - Critical: Blocks core functionality
  - High: Significantly impacts user experience
  - Medium: Causes inconvenience but has workarounds
  - Low: Minor issues with minimal impact

## Test Reporting

After each testing phase, a report will be generated documenting:
- Test coverage
- Pass/fail statistics
- Key issues discovered
- Performance metrics
- Recommendations for improvement
